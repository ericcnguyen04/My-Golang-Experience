# My-Golang-Experience

My internship switch from python to golang!

I never learned GoLang, so this repo will be used as my notes while learning GoLang!

## Aftermath
GoLang is easy to get a hang of! Maybe because I have prior experience coding but I got the hang of it fast. It's very similar to Javascript and I see this moment as a sign of growth!
